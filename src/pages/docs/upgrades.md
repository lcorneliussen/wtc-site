## Review the target, not just the installed binary

This handbook's examples target **v0.1.51**. That is a reviewed baseline, not a promise that it is the latest release.

Release notes are embedded, offline documents. Download the target binary before changing a harness pin, then use it to run:

```sh
wtc release-notes --since 0.1.48
wtc release-notes --list
```

The range excludes the baseline and unreleased changes. An older installed binary cannot fetch future notes. Use GitHub Releases for versions predating the release-notes command.

## Local harness upgrade

Review all changes since the old pin. Update `.wtc-cli-version` and the compatibility range together, preserving hooks and overrides. Run `wtc skills diff`, regenerate with `wtc env setup`, install tools with mise when used, then re-render skills and MCP configuration. Test changed behavior in a disposable collection before adoption. The shipped `wtc-harness-upgrade` skill provides the full procedure.

## OpenClaw gateway upgrade

The CLI and its embedded plugin must match. A gateway administrator replaces the CLI, runs `wtc openclaw install` to replace and reload its plugin, and reloads open Control UI tabs. Image-managed gateways should bump the pinned image inputs and redeploy instead of installing by hand. Use `wtc doctor --openclaw` afterward.

See the [upstream gateway guide](https://github.com/lcorneliussen/wtc-cli/blob/v0.1.51/docs/openclaw.md#upgrade) for prerequisites, image setup, and optional forge plugins. This upgrades WTC, not OpenClaw itself.

## Find the canonical release notes

The [GitHub release archive](https://github.com/lcorneliussen/wtc-cli/releases) and the numbered notes embedded in each binary share the same canonical source. Historical notes describe their release, not necessarily current behavior.

| Release | What to review |
| --- | --- |
| [0.1.49](https://github.com/lcorneliussen/wtc-cli/blob/v0.1.51/internal/wtc/release-notes/0.1.49.md) | Registry-driven project selection, explicit handling of unregistered repositories, collection folder layout |
| [0.1.50](https://github.com/lcorneliussen/wtc-cli/blob/v0.1.51/internal/wtc/release-notes/0.1.50.md) | Wtc projects terminology, PR titles/descriptions and notifications, sandbox catch-up |
| [0.1.51](https://github.com/lcorneliussen/wtc-cli/blob/v0.1.51/internal/wtc/release-notes/0.1.51.md) | Project suggestions, optional sent-message decision processing, quieter owner-session startup |

These are discovery summaries, not substitutes for the full upgrade range. For earlier history, use the [canonical notes archive](https://github.com/lcorneliussen/wtc-cli/tree/v0.1.51/internal/wtc/release-notes) or the target binary.

## Website maintenance

The site's checked-in coverage manifest records upstream sources, hashes, and intentional upstream-only material. Scheduled release checks prepare a review proposal; they never silently bump these instructions. A maintainer reviews the release, reconciles affected pages, and verifies the site before accepting a new baseline.
