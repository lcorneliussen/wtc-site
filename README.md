# wtc-site

The Astro website for **taba** (formerly wtc) and the getting-started handbook for [Worktree Collections](https://github.com/lcorneliussen/wtc-cli).

## Develop

Node.js 22.12+ is required; CI uses Node 24. Install development dependencies even if your environment sets `NODE_ENV=production`:

```sh
npm ci --include=dev
npm run dev
```

Open `http://localhost:4321/`. Astro 7 can auto-background the dev server in agent environments. For a foreground process supervisor, use:

```sh
npm run dev -- --ignore-lock --port 4321
```

Choose a free, collection-specific port when running multiple workspaces. In a WTC-managed collection with the dekit runtime enabled, the shared `.harness/dekit.tasks.yaml` defines the documentation preview. After installing dependencies, run from the collection root:

```sh
wtc svc up wtc-site/web
wtc svc logs wtc-site/web
wtc svc down wtc-site/web
```

The service runs Astro in the foreground on the collection's allocated `WTC_SITE_PORT`, with live reload and an HTTP readiness check. `wtc svc` shows its local URL. Optional tunnels belong in collection-local configuration; add one with `wtc svc tunnel wtc-site/web <provider>`.

## Verify

```sh
npm run check
npm run build
npm run test:links
npm run preview
```

The link check validates every generated HTML page’s internal links, fragments, assets, and GitHub Pages base path. It does not check external website availability. The interactive homepage also needs browser checks for collection switching, quick-start selection, clipboard behavior, and narrow viewports.

## Content and layout

- `src/pages/index.astro`: homepage and interactive collection example.
- `src/pages/docs/*.md`: handbook pages, with title, description, and upstream source in frontmatter.
- `src/layouts/Docs.astro` and `src/components/DocsNav.astro`: documentation shell and navigation.
- `src/styles/global.css`: shared responsive design and reduced-motion support.
- `src/scripts/home.js`: collection example and quick-start controls.

Local-terminal examples follow the upstream CLI getting-started guide and explicitly pin v0.1.51. OpenClaw guidance is separately labeled for the gateway-integrated build; it must not suggest `wtc init` or `wtc new` on a gateway. Reconcile both with their upstream instructions when updating commands.

## Documentation coverage and release intake

See [content ownership and the audit](docs/content-strategy.md) and the [coverage inventory](docs/coverage.json).

```sh
npm run test:coverage
npm run check:coverage
npm run check:coverage -- /path/to/reviewed-cli-checkout
npm run docs:propose -- /path/to/current-cli-checkout main /tmp/docs-review.md
```

The read-only documentation workflow checks the pinned baseline on PRs and prepares a weekly/manual upstream review report. It does not rewrite pages or deploy. Source digests detect change; semantic review remains required.

## GitHub Pages

Production target: **https://taba.sh/**. Astro uses that canonical origin and `/` base. Shared links use `import.meta.env.BASE_URL`. Old `wtc.sh` links redirect with their paths preserved.

PRs check and build without deploying. Pushes to `main` and manual runs on `main` deploy the static artifact. Enable Pages with **GitHub Actions** as its source first.

See [the launch checklist](docs/launch.md) for domain verification, DNS, HTTPS, smoke tests, and rollback. An Actions deployment ignores CNAME files: configure the domain in repository Settings → Pages. Local checks do not configure GitHub or DNS.

## OpenClaw screenshots and recordings

See [the plugin coverage audit and media workflow](docs/openclaw-coverage.md).
Capture the actual upstream plugin renderer using synthetic data, without a
running gateway, forge account or server:

```sh
npm ci --include=dev
npx playwright install chromium
npm run demos:openclaw -- /absolute/path/to/wtc-cli
```

Pass a second argument for a separate output directory. Review the PNGs, WebM,
and provenance before committing them. The manual **OpenClaw demo capture**
workflow produces review artifacts only; it never updates or deploys the site.

For captioned push/refresh and catch-up interactions, see the
[interaction recording guide](docs/recording-openclaw-interactions.md):

```sh
npm run demos:openclaw:interactions -- /absolute/path/to/wtc-cli
```

Open `artifacts/openclaw-interactions/index.html` to watch the clips. These use
the actual renderer with simulated gateway responses, not a live account.
